LED patterns for the Iris Rains installation, June 2022.

LED patterns progress as follows:
1. Randomly choose a color palette and fill pattern
2. Fill all wedges of the umbrella
3. Randomly choose and run a 'static' pattern, i.e. where all LEDs remain lit and colors move
4. Randomly choose palette and run the Light Rain algorithm
5. Randomly run Light Rain with a new color or move to next pattern
6. Randomly choose whethe to run rainbow spin pattern
7. Randomly choose empty pattern and turn off all LEDs
